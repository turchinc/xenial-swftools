Usage: %s <fontfile>

Converts a font to SWF.

Takes a font file (.ttf, .afm, .pfa, .pfb and all other types
supported by FreeType) and converts it into a SWF file.
.PP
The SWF will contain the Font in SWF format (that is, a
DefineFont2 Tag) as well as a textfield containing all the
characters the font has. This means the resulting SWF will
be viewable.

-o, --output <filename>
    Write output to file <filename>.
    Write output to file <filename>. (If not given, the output will go
    to a file called "output.swf")
-V, --version
